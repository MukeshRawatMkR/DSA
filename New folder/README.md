-----------------
**Core Patterns to Remember(20)** 

Sliding Window

Used in subarray/substring problems with sums, averages, or constraints.

Example: Maximum sum subarray of size K, Longest substring without repeating characters.

Two Pointers

Used when dealing with sorted arrays, linked lists, or strings.

Example: Pair sum, Remove duplicates from sorted array, Palindrome check.

Fast and Slow Pointers (Floyd’s Cycle)

Used to detect cycles in linked lists or arrays.

Example: Linked list cycle detection, Find middle of linked list.

Merge Intervals

When you deal with ranges or overlapping intervals.

Example: Merge overlapping intervals, Insert interval, Meeting rooms problem.

Cyclic Sort

Used when numbers fall in a fixed range (1 to n).

Example: Find missing number, Find duplicate, First missing positive.

In-place Reversal of Linked List

Used in reversing parts of a linked list.

Example: Reverse linked list, Reverse sublist, Reorder list.

Tree Traversals (DFS & BFS)

DFS: Preorder, Inorder, Postorder.

BFS: Level order traversal, Zigzag level order.

Binary Search

Classic search on sorted arrays or answer space.

Example: Search in rotated sorted array, Find first/last occurrence, Minimum in rotated sorted array.

Top K Elements (Heap pattern)

When asked for largest, smallest, or K-th frequent items.

Example: Kth largest element, Top K frequent numbers, Sliding window maximum.

Modified Binary Search

Variants like binary search on answers, peak element, search in bitonic array.

Subsets (Backtracking / Bitmasking)

Generate combinations, subsets, or permutations.

Example: Subsets, Subsets with duplicates, Permutations, Combination sum.

Dynamic Programming Patterns

0/1 Knapsack (choose or skip).

Unbounded Knapsack (reusable items).

Fibonacci Numbers (basic recursion + memoization).

Longest Common Subsequence (strings).

Palindromic Subsequence/Substring.

Matrix DP (unique paths, minimum path sum).

DP on Subsets (partition, target sum).

Graph Traversal Patterns

BFS (shortest path in unweighted graph).

DFS (connected components, cycle detection).

Topological Sort (DAG scheduling).

Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall (weighted shortest path).

Union-Find (disjoint set problems).

Backtracking / Recursion

N-Queens, Sudoku solver, Word search.

Generate all possible configurations.

Greedy Pattern

When local optimal choice gives global optimum.

Example: Activity selection, Huffman coding, Minimum spanning tree (Kruskal/Prim).

Matrix Traversal Patterns

Spiral traversal, DFS/BFS in matrix, Flood fill, Connected islands.

Monotonic Stack/Queue

Next greater element, Largest rectangle in histogram, Trapping rain water.

Bit Manipulation Patterns

Subsets using bits, XOR tricks, Single number, Power of two check.

Hashing & Prefix Sum

Subarray sum problems, Longest subarray with given sum, Count subarrays divisible by K.

Topological Variants

Course scheduling, Alien dictionary.
